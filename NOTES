- Explore elm make logic which runs compilation in parallel. This parallelism makes it more difficult for me to write the output of the declaration dependency analysis into single file..

- Explore logic, which skips the compilation of a file, if it's already present in the cache. I'l like to avoid this skipping so that the file is compiled every time and I don't have to delete elm-stuff to force recompilation.
